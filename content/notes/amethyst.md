#### Amethyst Workflow

I have always been fond of tiling window managers which completely utilizes each and every space that you see on your screen. 

Coming from linux to mac, you might also be searching to integrate tiling window manager on your mac workflow similar to Xmonad, i3 or bspwm.

While the experience won't be snappy as Xmonand or i3, but you can get closer to it with Amethyst (at least for me). There are other tiling managers for macos other than Amethyst but here I will share my workflow with amethyst.

Switch between different layouts:

- `Alt+Shift+Space`

I prefer Column or Tall Layout, depending on the flow.

Switch to Column Layout:

- `Alt+Shift+F`

If more than 3 windows where feasible portrait layouts. Column would be more productive.

Move focus clockwise/anti-clockwise around windows:
- `Alt+Shift+J` / `Alt+Shift+K`

Increase or decrease the Window Size:
- `Alt+Shift+H` / `Alt+Shift+L` 

Swap focus to main window:
There are times when you quickly need to swap focus to the main window.
- `Alt+Shift+Enter`

Switch Order of the Windows:
- `Alt+Shift+Control+J` / `Alt+Shift+Control+K`

Make the focused window full screen:
- `Alt+Shift+D`

Get back to Tall Layout:
- `Alt+Shift+A`

What about stickies and small apps?
Register small window apps as floating window:
