### Statistics

> the mathematical science that deals with the collection, analysis, and presentation of data, which can be then be used as a basis for inference and induction

- infer a conclusion



### Data and Information

| Data                                                         | Information                                                                                             |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| values with no meaning (raw facts, measurements of interest) | once the data is processed it then is used for making a decision or can be used for a specific purpose. |
|                                                              |                                                                                                         |

### Data Set and Database

| Data Set                  | Database      |
|---------------------------|---------------|
| collection of data points | row / columns |

### Sources of Data

| Primary Data                            | Secondary Data                                           |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| collected by self who is using the data | Collected by someone else                                |
| expensive, time consuming               | quick, readily available                                 |
| reliable                                | not reliable                                             |
| sole control over the data              | published on magazines, newspapers or any published data |

#### Collection Methods (Primary Data)


| Experiments | Direct Observation | Surveys /Questionnaires |
|-------------|--------------------|-------------------------|
|             |                    |                         |

Biased Surveys:
Choose one from below (Forcing the user to take survey which can lead to ambiguous answer)

### Two Types of Data
| Qualitative                                   | Quantitative                  |
| ---                                           | ---                           |
| Classified by descriptive terms: For example, | Described by numerical values |
| Marital Status                                |                               |
| Political Party                               |                               |


Within Quantitative Data:

| Counted                          | Measured                           |
| ---                              | ---                                |
| Number of Children               | Weight                             |
| Defects per hour (Counted items) | Voltage (Measured Characteristics) |


### Data by Level of Measurement

| Level    | Description                                                        | Example                                   |
| ---      | ---                                                                | ---                                       |
| Nominal  | No ranking allowed                                                 | Postal Codes                              |
| Ordinal  | Ranking Allowed but no measurable meaning to the number difference | Education Level (PHD, Masters, Bachelors) |
| Interval | Meaningful but no zero points                                      | Calendar Year (2018, 2019)                |
| Ratio    | Has zero points to reference from                                  | Income ($80,000)                          |

### Time Series vs. Cross-Sectional Data

| Time Series                           | Cross-Sectional Data                                     |
| ---                                   | ---                                                      |
| Over the multiple years (2010-2020)   | Within 2010 Data of (TX, AL, NY, CA, MN)                 |
| With time series we can observe trend | Compare data at one particular point of time             |


### Population vs. Sample
| Population            | Sample                                                            |
| ---                   | ---                                                               |
| all possible subjects | refers to a portion of the population (represents the population) |


### Parameter vs Statistics
| Parameter                         | Statistics                  |
| -----                             | ---                         |
| Values calculated from population | Values computed from sample |



### Inferential Statistics

- Biased Samples
  - a sample that does not represent the population


### Ways to Misuse Statistics
- Changing the graph scale
- Choosing biased samples


### Branches of Statistics:

- Descriptive
  - collecting, summarizing and displaying data

- Inferential
  - make conclusions/claims based on the sample data

- Predictive
  - take data from the past and predict the future values and make decisions


Chebyshev's Theorem

- not commonly used.
- we work mostly with Normal Distributions

Average is the best way to represent the entire group if there are no outliers.

Probability

- Numerical value ranging from 0 to 1.
- 0 being no chance of probability to 1 being 100% occurring of the event.

Experiment
-

Sample Space
- All the possible outcomes.


Event
- One of the outcome of an experiment.
- Outcome is basically a subset of the sample space.


Simple Event
- Single Outcome which the most basic form that cannot be further simplified.


Three Methods of Assigning Probability

- Classical
- Empirical
- Subjective


### Classical Probability

P(A) = Number of possible outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes

Experiment: Roll a die once
Sample space = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

P(A) = 1/6 = 0.167 or a 16.7% probability.


### Empirical Probability
- Conducting the experiment to observe the frequency with which an event occurs.


P(A) = Frequency in which Event A Occurs/Total number of observations


Law of Large Numbers
Whenever the experiment is done more than


### Subjective Probability

- Used when classical and empirical probabilities are not available.
- Example: The probability of inflation will be more than 4% next year.


#### Five Basic Properties of Probability

- Event A must occur.
- Even A will not occur.
- Must range from 0 to 1.
- The sum of all the probabilities for the simple events in the sample space must be equal to 1.
- Complement to Event A is defined as all of the outcomes of

Formula for the complement rule:
P(A) + P(A') = 1


#### Baye's Theorem


### Qualitative and Quantitative

Nominal
- deals with qualitative data

Ordinal
