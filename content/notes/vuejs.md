Vue JS

Written on: 2018, September 30th

ESSENTIAL

Multi-word component names: Component names should always be multi-word, except for root App components.
Prevents conflicts with existing and future HTML elements, since all the html elements are in single word.
Examples: BreadCrumbs, OrganizationForm, OrganizationDetail, OrganizationPolicies and so on.
Component Data: Component data must be a function.
Example: Image
Prop Definitions: Prop definitions should be as detailed as possible.
Keyed v-for: Always use key with v-for.
Avoid v-if with v-for: Never use v-if on the same element as v-for.
