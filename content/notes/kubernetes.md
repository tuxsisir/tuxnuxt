### Containers and Kubernetes

Questions:

- Running Kubernetes on vm only without cloud providers?

Develop Kubernetes enabled applications.
Skafold

* What is kubernetes? (Short form - k8s)
- scale up the system
- orchestration tool
- orchestrate dockerized applications
- more effective use of servers / space

* What is kubernetes cluster?
*
* What is cloud native application?

* Kubernetes vs docker


"Desired State Management"


### Containers
----
- It needs to be managed.
- Networking is definitely hard.
- Containers must be scheduled, distributed and load balanced.
- And the data's got to be persisted somewhere.


### Kubernetes
---
- "Kubernetes" greek word for captain or pilot of the ship.
- running 1000 of containers on production
- not tied to a specific cloud provider
- manage resources on the cloud
- if a container goes down, another container gets started, handled by a sweet system (kubernetes)


- Kubernetes uses `labels` as "nametags" to identify things and it can query based on these labels

### Kubernetes - PODS
---
- a runnable unit of work
- generally, we use only one container per pod.
- a pod can hold any number of containers, but usually it only holds two (tightly coupled containers).
- a pod is connected via an overlay network to the rest of the environment.
- Kubernetes (works for us) by connecting the pods to the network and rest of the kubernets ecosystem.

### Kubernetes - Replication Controllers
---
- for managing any arbitrary(random) number of pods

Pod Template
- for creating any number of pod copies, as much as necessary when scaling.

Provides logic for scaling the pod up or down

Through the Replication controllers, kubernetes will manage pod lifecycle, scaling up and down, rolling deployments and monitoring.

![](../../images/k8s/replication-controllers.png)


### Kubernetes services
---
- tells the rest of kubernetes environment(pods and replication controllers) what services application provides.
- pods may come and go but ip addr and ports remain the same.
- other service can find our service through kubernetes service discovery

----

- it is persistent.
- provides discovery.
- load balances
- provides VIP layer `???`
- identifies pods by label selector

![](../../images/k8s/k8s-services.png)


### Kubernetes - Volumes
---
- location where containers can access or store information
- for application volume is local file system

volumes maybe backed by storage backends such as: ceph, gluster(red hat), Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)

![](../../images/k8s/volumes.png)

### Kubernetes - Namespace
---

#### What is namespace?
- organizing resources in namespace
- virtual cluster inside a cluster

### Namespaces

#### Minikube
- minikube comes with `kubernetes-dashboard` namespace which is not provided on standard cluster.

kube-system (namespace)
- dont' modify

kube-public


#### Kubernetes
- 4 Namespaces Default
- grouping mechanism inside kubernetes
- services, pods, repliaction controllers and volumes could easily co-operate within a namespace

![](../../images/k8s/namespace.png)

![](../../images/k8s/namespace-overview.png)

### Nodes
---
- maybe a vm or physical machine depending on the cluster
- has the services necessary to run application containers



##### Kubernetes - HELM

What is Helm?

- package manager for kubernetes
- to package yaml files and distribute them to public / private repositories

The package manager for Kubernetes: tool for installing, upgrading and managing applications on a Kubernetes cluster.

#### Helm Packages (Charts)
- describes how we install packages onto a Kubernetes cluster.

helm has two parts

|A Client (Helm)|A Server (Tiler)|
|:---------------|:-----------------|
|local helm client sends instructions to `tiller` in the cluster | runs inside of kubernetes cluster|
|||




- install helm
`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/helm/master/scripts/get | bash`

helm installed into /usr/local/bin/helm
tiller installed into /usr/local/bin/tiller
`Run 'helm init' to configure helm.`

### Best Practices

### Namespaces

- virtual cluster within a cluster

Kubernetes cluster has 3 namespaces by default:

- default (all the default goes here)
- kube-system (no need to touch it)
- kube-public (leave it alone)


- display all namespaces
    - `$ kubens`
- switch to namespace
    - `$ kubens test`


different teams should be using different namespaces:

- codehub-prod
- codehub-dev

- fuse-ai-prod
- fuse-ai-dev

istio
- cross communication using
- Connect, secure, control, and observe services.

spinnaker
- Cloud Native Continuous Delivery
Fast, safe, repeatable deployments for every Enterprise

## Kubernetes Concepts

### What is Kubernetes?
---

```
Kubernetes is a production-grade, open-source platform that orchestrates the placement (scheduling) and execution of application containers within and across computer clusters.
```

- **Kubernetes automates the distribution and scheduling of application containers across a cluster in a more efficient way.**

![](../../images/k8s/k8s-basic-modules.png)


### What are Kubernetes Clusters?
---
```A Kubernetes cluster consists of two types of resources:```

- master
    - The **master** coordinates the cluster.
- node
    - **Nodes** are the workers that run applications.

![](../../images/k8s/kubernetes-cluster-diagram.svg)


### Masters
---

```
Masters manage the cluster and the nodes that are used to host the running applications.
```

- responsible for managing the cluster.
- etcd -> single source of truth regarding the key value pairs of pods information on kubernetes cluster.
- scheduler / controller as same as their name suggests.

![](../../images/k8s/master-node.jpg)

### Node

```
A node is a VM or a physical computer that serves as a `worker machine` in a Kubernetes cluster.
```

- Each node consists of:
    - kubelet
    - kube proxy
    - a container runtime, responsible for pulling the container image, unpacking and running on a machine.
    - managed by `The Master`

- A `Node` can have multiple pods.


**A Kubernetes cluster that handles production traffic should have a minimum of three nodes.**

![](../../images/k8s/node.png)

![](../../images/k8s/nodes-overview.svg)


### Kubernetes Deployment (Application Management)
---
```
Deployment instructs Kubernetes how to create and update instances of our application and ***responsible for creating and updating instances of our application***
```

- need to specify the container image for our application.
- need to specify the the number of replicas that we want to run.

**Kubernetes master schedules the application instances included in the Deployment to run on individual Nodes in the cluster.**
#### Deployment Controller
- continously monitors application instances

#### Self Healing Mechanism
- If the `NODE` hosting an instance goes down or is deleted, the `Deployment controller` replaces the instance with an instance on another `NODE` in the cluster.


*Applications need to be packaged into one of the supported container formats in order to be deployed on Kubernetes*

![](../../images/k8s/deployment.svg)

### Pods
---
```
A Pod is a group of one or more application containers (such as Docker or rkt) and includes shared storage (volumes), IP address and information about how to run them.
```

- can contain different different application containers.
- Pods are the atomic unit on the Kubernetes platform.
- When we create a Deployment on Kubernetes, that Deployment creates Pods with containers inside them (as opposed to creating containers directly)
- Pods are `mortal`

- In case of Node `failure`, identical pods are scheduled on other available `Nodes` in the cluster.

![](../../images/k8s/pod.svg)


### Kubernetes Services
---

```
A Service in Kubernetes is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them.
```

- Although each Pod has a unique IP address, those IPs **are not exposed** outside the cluster without a `Service`.
- Services allow our applications to receive traffic.
- A Service routes traffic across a set of Pods.

`$ kubectl expose deployment hello-node --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080`

*Services can be exposed in different ways by specifying a type in the ServiceSpec:*

|Cluster IP(default)| NodePort | Load Balancer | External Name |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Exposes the Service on an internal IP in the cluster.|Exposes the Service on the same port of each selected Node in the cluster using NAT. Makes a Service accessible from outside the cluster using <NodeIP>:<NodePort>.|Creates an external load balancer in the current cloud (if supported) and assigns a fixed, external IP to the Service.|Exposes the Service using an arbitrary name (specified by externalName in the spec) by returning a CNAME record with the name.|

### Kubernetes ReplicaSet
---
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/

### Kubernetes Labels and Selectors
---
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/

### Kubernetes Manifest
---
Manifests are a way to declaratively define our microservice.

### Kubectl
---
```
Kubectl uses the Kubernetes API to interact with the cluster
```

- `$ kubectl get` - **list resources**
- `$ kubectl describe` - **show detailed information about a resource**
- `$ kubectl logs` - **print the logs from a container in a pod**
- `$ kubectl exec` - **execute a command on a container in a pod**

### Kubernetes Scaling
---

```
When traffic increases, we will need to scale the application to keep up with user demand.
```

- Scaling is accomplished by changing the number of replicas in a Deployment

### Kubernetes Configuration (YAML Cheats)

- every configuration consists of 3 different parts:
    - metadata
    - specification (specs) `DESIRED STATE`
    - status (automatically generated by k8s)`Actual State`
        - k8s maintains status from the kubernetes master `etcd`


# Persistent Volumes

### Why PV?

- because of multiple storage architectures
- one storage interface to deal with different storage solution

### Storage Infrastructure

![](../../images/k8s/storage_infrastructure.png)


### Persistent Volume (PV)

- piece of storage in cluster (administrators)

### Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)

- request for storage (developers)

#### Access modes

- read / write
- read only

![](../../images/k8s/storage-access-modes.png)


### Lifecycle of PV

![](../../images/k8s/pv-lifecycle.png)

### Static PV

![](../../images/k8s/static-pv.png)


### Dynamic PV

![](../../images/k8s/dynamic-pv.png)

### Binding
- pvc pointing to pv or a storage class = binding

![](../../images/k8s/pv-claims/binding.png)

### We cannot bind two pvc's to a single pv

![](../../images/k8s/pv-claims/cannot-bind-2-pvc-to-same-pv.png)

![](../../images/k8s/pv-claims/cannot-bind-2-pvc-to-same-pv-draw.png)

### However, we can bind pods to same pvc
![](../../images/k8s/pv-claims/can-bind-pod.png)

### PVC is binded to either PV or StorageClass
![](../../images/k8s/pv-claims/either-or.png)
